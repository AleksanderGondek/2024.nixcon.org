NixCon is a community-oriented conference for contributors and users of Nix and
NixOS. It's about sharing experiences, inspiring people and discussing future
development.

We would like to learn about how you use Nix and NixOS in your organization and
what you are currently working on.

The growth of NixOS as a project brings its own challenges and we would like to
know how you think the user experience can be improved and how NixOS can be
scaled.
