NixCon is a community-oriented conference and hackcentre for
contributors and users of Nix and NixOS. It's about sharing
experiences, inspiring people, discussing future development or just
hanging out with fellow contributors.

This is an event by the community for the community. We want to show
that we are self-sufficient, and for that reason, there will be no
sponsorships this time. We want to have a larger emphasis on workshops
and on working together on problems we deeply care about.

You can expect workshops and talks for beginners, intermediates, and
pros alike. An open hackcentre where you can collaborate on your
projects or just chill. Finally, a hackday during which you can work
on important projects or just hang out with other Nix hackers.
